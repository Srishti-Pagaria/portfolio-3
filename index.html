        <p>Books are my ultimate friend. I like spending time with them. Whether it is a mood to increase knowledge or entertainment – they are always available. Read as much as you want, when you want, read whatever you want. No limits, limitless topics, unlimited availability. Reading fiction stories, jokes, novels, dramas, biographies, travel stories are all interesting and informative to humans. Books are our best friends, it never deceives us.

            Books never allow the feeling of loneliness. But a caution about the books is necessary. According to our age, we should study only useful books on appropriate subjects.
